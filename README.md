# About
The Wicket is a 2D puzzle-adventure game kept in dark, survival horror style. Gameplay involves levels based on classical maze with unconventional riddles, which require deep analysis and out-of-the-box thinking, as well as arcade elemets calling for precision and good timing. Mysterious setting in dying, abandoned world provides the backgorund for confusing, unsettling story supported by original soundtrack and quaint visuals.

The game is still in development, but first chapter "Subjection" is completed and open for beta-testing.

# Download
